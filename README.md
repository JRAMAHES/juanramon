How email works?
     Email works by operating across the Internet or other computer networks. A couple decades ago email systems required the author and the recipient to both be online at the same time, like in common with instant messaging. Neither the user nor computers are required to be online simultaneously that they need connect only briefly, typically to a mail server, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.
	An internet email message consists of three components, the massages envelope, the message header, and the message body. The message header contains control of the information, including, minimally, an originatorâ€™s email address and one or more recipient addresses.
